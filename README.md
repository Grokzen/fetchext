# 📦 fetchext

A Python CLI tool to download browser extensions (Chrome, Edge, Firefox) directly from their web stores. 🚀

## �� Development and Agent Tooling

This repository is an experiment in **100% Vibe Coding** - all code is generated, maintained, and evolved exclusively through Agent tooling. No manual coding is permitted. ✨

### 🧪 Experimental Setup

* **IDE**: VSCode Insider program (required for Agent integration) 💻
* **AI Model**: Gemini 2.0 Flash or Grok 3 Beta (exclusively) 🧠
* **Approach**: Zero manual intervention - all development is Agent-driven ⚡

### 📜 100% Vibe Coding Policy

This project serves as a proof-of-concept for fully automated software development:

* **No Manual Code**: All code changes must be produced by the Agent. 🚫✋
* **Rejection Criteria**: Manual submissions or changes from other AI models will be rejected. ❌
* **Quality Control**: The Agent maintains consistent coding standards and patterns. ✅
* **Evolution**: The codebase grows and adapts through iterative Agent interactions. 🌱

### 📝 Submission Guidelines

To participate in this experiment:

* Use only VSCode Insider with Gemini 2.0 Flash or Grok 3 Beta for any interactions.
* Allow the Agent to handle all code modifications.
* Manual pull requests will be declined to preserve the purity of the experiment.
* Report issues or request features through Agent-mediated channels. 🗣️

This repository demonstrates the potential of fully automated development workflows while maintaining high code quality and consistency.

## 📋 Requirements

* Python 3.11 or higher 🐍

Given that we have done a few things in the roadmap now, lets re-evaluate the roadmap and you look into what further and additional things you want to add and contribute to the repo and the tool. Analyze the current state of the repo. ensure you have 5 items to implement within each release. Make them spread out across different areas of the code to avoid implementing to much of the same thing within a release.

The review output should update the roadmap file to reflect the changees you like to implement.

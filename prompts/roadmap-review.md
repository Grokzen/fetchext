# Roadmap Review Prompt

Given that we have completed several items in the roadmap, let's re-evaluate the project's direction and identify further contributions. Analyze the current state of the repository and propose a comprehensive plan for the next steps.

**Requirements:**

1. **Quantity**: Ensure there are exactly **10 items** to implement within each release.
2. **Scope**: Plan for the next **2 releases** only.
3. **Detail**: For each item, provide a detailed description (more than just one line) explaining **what** needs to be implemented and **why** it is valuable.
4. **Balance**: Distribute the 10 items in each release evenly across the following categories:
    * **Fixing existing code**: Refactoring, bug fixes, or technical debt reduction.
    * **New Features**: Adding completely new capabilities to the tool.
    * **Testing**: Improving test coverage, adding new test types (e.g., fuzzing, performance), or enhancing the test suite.
    * **Improving old features**: Polishing, optimizing, or extending existing functionality.
    * **Innovation**: Introducing new tools, methods, libraries, or architectural concepts.

The output should be an updated `ROADMAP.md` file reflecting these changes.

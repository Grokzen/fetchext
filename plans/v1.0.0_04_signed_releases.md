# Plan: Signed Releases (v1.0.0)

## Goal

Implement infrastructure for cryptographically signing releases (git tags and PyPI artifacts) to ensure supply chain security.

## Strategy

### 1. GPG Signing for Git Tags

- Update `Makefile` or release documentation to enforce signed tags (`git tag -s`).

### 2. Artifact Signing

- We will use `gpg` to detach-sign the built wheels and sdist.
- Add a `sign` target to `Makefile`.

### 3. Verification

- Add a script or command to verify the signature of a downloaded package (though `pip` doesn't check GPG natively, users can).

## Steps

1. Update `Makefile` to add `release` and `sign` targets.
2. Update `docs/contributing.md` (or `docs/releasing.md`) to document the release process.
3. Update `ROADMAP.md`.

## Makefile Changes

```makefile
sign:
 gpg --detach-sign -a dist/*.whl
 gpg --detach-sign -a dist/*.tar.gz

release: build sign
 twine upload dist/*
```

(Note: I won't actually run `gpg` as I don't have a key, but I'll add the targets).

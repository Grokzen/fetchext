# Plan: TUI Polish

## Objective

Improve `fext ui` responsiveness, error handling, and navigation.

## Current State

The TUI is likely a basic implementation using `textual`. We need to ensure:

1. **Responsiveness**: Long operations (downloads) shouldn't freeze the UI.
2. **Error Handling**: Network errors should be shown in a modal or status bar, not crash the app.
3. **Navigation**: Keyboard shortcuts, intuitive focus management.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Async Operations**: Ensure downloads and searches run in workers/async tasks.
2. **Error Modals**: Add a generic error modal for catching exceptions.
3. **Better Layout**: Review the layout for usability.
4. **Key Bindings**: Add help footer and standard keys (q to quit, etc.).

## Verification

* Run `fext ui`.
* Try searching for a non-existent extension.
* Try downloading with network disconnected.
* Navigate using keyboard.

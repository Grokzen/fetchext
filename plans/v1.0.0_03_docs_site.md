# Plan: Documentation Site (v1.0.0)

## Goal

Create a comprehensive static documentation site using MkDocs and deploy it to GitHub Pages.

## Tools

- **MkDocs**: Static site generator.
- **MkDocs Material**: A popular, professional theme for MkDocs.
- **mkdocstrings**: To auto-generate API documentation from Python docstrings (since we have a library mode).

## Strategy

### 1. Setup

- Add `mkdocs`, `mkdocs-material`, `mkdocstrings[python]` to `requirements-dev.txt`.
- Initialize `mkdocs.yml`.

### 2. Content Structure

- `index.md`: Introduction and Quick Start (from README).
- `installation.md`: Detailed installation instructions.
- `cli.md`: CLI Reference (generated from `fext --help` or manually).
- `library.md`: Python API Reference (using `mkdocstrings`).
- `configuration.md`: Config file reference.
- `contributing.md`: Contribution guidelines.
- `changelog.md`: Release notes (from CHANGELOG.md).

### 3. Configuration (`mkdocs.yml`)

- Set theme to `material`.
- Configure navigation.
- Enable plugins (`search`, `mkdocstrings`).

### 4. Integration

- Add `make docs-serve` and `make docs-build` targets.
- (Optional) Add GitHub Actions workflow for deployment (or just document how to do it). Since I can't easily set up the repo settings for GH Pages, I'll just prepare the workflow file.

## Steps

1. Update `requirements-dev.txt`.
2. Create `mkdocs.yml`.
3. Create `docs/` directory structure (move existing man/completions to `docs/artifacts/` or keep them separate). MkDocs usually expects source files in `docs/`.
    - *Note*: I already have `docs/man` and `docs/completions`. I should probably put the site source in `docs_src/` or configure `docs_dir` in `mkdocs.yml` to point to `site_docs/` to avoid confusion, OR just use `docs/` and move the artifacts to `docs/assets/`.
    - Decision: Use `docs/` for the site source. Move `man` and `completions` to `docs/assets/` or just keep them there and exclude them from navigation if needed, or link to them.
4. Populate markdown files.
5. Build and verify.

# Plan: Shell Completion Verification

## Objective
Verify and improve the shell completion scripts for Bash and Zsh to ensure they cover all current CLI commands and flags.

## Current State
-   `scripts/gen_completion.py` exists.
-   It likely uses `shtab` or similar, or manual generation.
-   Need to check if it's up to date with recent command additions (e.g., `plugin`, `serve`, `timeline`).

## Proposed Changes
1.  **Audit**: Check `scripts/gen_completion.py` content.
2.  **Update**: If it uses a library that auto-detects argparse, it might just need running. If manual, update it.
3.  **Enhancement**: Ensure it supports subcommands of subcommands (e.g., `fext config set`).

## Implementation Details
-   Run `python scripts/gen_completion.py`.
-   Inspect output in `docs/completions/`.
-   If using `shtab`, ensure it's installed and configured correctly in `pyproject.toml` or the script.

## Verification
-   Generate scripts.
-   Manually inspect them for new commands (`plugin`, `serve`).
-   (Optional) Source them in a shell to test.

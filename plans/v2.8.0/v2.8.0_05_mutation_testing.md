# Plan: Mutation Testing

## 1. Introduction

To ensure our security scanners (YARA, Secrets) are actually effective, we need to test them against variations of malicious code.

## 2. Objectives

- Integrate `mutmut` or write a custom mutation test suite.
- Verify that scanners catch slightly modified signatures.

## 3. Implementation Details

### 3.1. Test Suite

- Create `tests/fuzz/test_scanners.py`.
- Define a set of "base" malicious patterns (e.g., a known key format).
- Apply mutations:
  - Change variable names.
  - Add whitespace.
  - Split strings (`"pass" + "word"`).
- Run the scanner against these mutations.

### 3.2. Metrics

- Report "Detection Rate".
- If detection drops below a threshold, fail the test.

## 4. Verification

- **Run**: `pytest tests/fuzz/test_scanners.py`.
- **Assert**: Scanners are robust against simple obfuscation.

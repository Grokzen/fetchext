# Plan: Report Metadata Expansion

## 1. Introduction

Reports currently lack context on when an extension was published or updated.

## 2. Objectives

- Fetch "First Seen" and "Last Updated" dates from Web Store (if available via scraping or API).
- Include in `fext report`.

## 3. Implementation Details

### 3.1. Data Source

- The standard download URL doesn't provide metadata.
- We might need to scrape the Web Store page (e.g., `https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/...`).
- **Note**: Scraping is fragile. Use with caution. Alternatively, use the `update_url` XML response which might contain version info, but not dates.
- If scraping is required, implement a `MetadataFetcher` class.

### 3.2. Report Update

- Add fields to the JSON and HTML report schemas.
- Display in the "Overview" section.

## 4. Verification

- **Test**: Generate report for a known extension.
- **Assert**: "Last Updated" field is present and looks like a date.

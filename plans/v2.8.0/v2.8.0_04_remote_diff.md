# Plan: Remote Diff

## 1. Introduction

Comparing a local version against the live Web Store version usually requires downloading the live one manually.

## 2. Objectives

- Add `fext diff --remote <id>`.
- Compare local directory/file against the current Web Store version.

## 3. Implementation Details

### 3.1. Workflow

1. User runs `fext diff ./my-ext --remote <id>`.
2. Tool downloads the latest CRX for `<id>` to a temp folder.
3. Tool extracts it.
4. Tool runs the standard `diff` logic between `./my-ext` and `temp_folder`.
5. Cleanup temp folder.

### 3.2. CLI

- Update `DiffCommand` to accept `--remote` flag.
- If `--remote` is present, the second argument is treated as an Extension ID, not a file path.

## 4. Verification

- **Test**: Mock the downloader. Run diff against a "remote" ID.
- **Assert**: Downloader is called, then diff is performed.

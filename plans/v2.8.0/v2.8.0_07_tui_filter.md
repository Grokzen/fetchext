# Plan: TUI Filter Bar

## 1. Introduction

In `fext ui`, finding an extension in a long list is difficult.

## 2. Objectives

- Add a filter/search input to the TUI lists.
- Real-time filtering.

## 3. Implementation Details

### 3.1. UI Component

- Add an `Input` widget above the `DataTable` in the TUI.
- Label: "Filter...".

### 3.2. Logic

- Listen for `Input.Changed` events.
- Filter the rows in the `DataTable` based on the input text (match ID or Name).
- `textual`'s `DataTable` might need to be cleared and repopulated, or rows hidden (if supported). Repopulating is safer.

## 4. Verification

- **Test**: Open TUI. Type "adblock".
- **Assert**: Only extensions with "adblock" in name/id are visible.
